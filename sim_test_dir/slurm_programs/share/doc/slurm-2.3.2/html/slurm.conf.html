<H1>slurm.conf</H1>
Section: Slurm configuration file (5)<BR>Updated: September 2011<BR><A HREF="#index">Index</A>

<H2>NAME</H2>

slurm.conf - Slurm configuration file
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<a id="SECTION_DESCRIPTION"></a>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>slurm.conf</B> is an ASCII file which describes general SLURM
configuration information, the nodes to be managed, information about
how those nodes are grouped into partitions, and various scheduling
parameters associated with those partitions. This file should be
consistent across all nodes in the cluster.
<P>

The file location can be modified at system build time using the
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter or at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF
environment variable. The SLURM daemons also allow you to override
both the built-in and environment-provided location using the &quot;-f&quot;
option on the command line.
<P>

The contents of the file are case insensitive except for the names of nodes
and partitions. Any text following a &quot;#&quot; in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
The size of each line in the file is limited to 1024 characters.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
SLURM daemons, daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal, or execution
of the command &quot;scontrol reconfigure&quot; unless otherwise noted.
<P>

If a line begins with the word &quot;Include&quot; followed by whitespace
and then a file name, that file will be included inline with the current
configuration file.
<P>

Note on file permissions:
<P>

The <I>slurm.conf</I> file must be readable by all users of SLURM, since it
is used by many of the SLURM commands.  Other files that are defined
in the <I>slurm.conf</I> file, such as log files and job accounting files,
may need to be created/owned by the user &quot;SlurmUser&quot; to be successfully
accessed.  Use the &quot;chown&quot; and &quot;chmod&quot; commands to set the ownership
and permissions appropriately.
See the section <B>FILE AND DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS</B> for information
about the various files and directories used by SLURM.

<H2>PARAMETERS</H2>

<P>

The overall configuration parameters available include:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<a id="OPT_AccountingStorageBackupHost"></a>
<DT><B>AccountingStorageBackupHost</B><DD>
The name of the backup machine hosting the accounting storage database.
If used with the accounting_storage/slurmdbd plugin, this is where the backup
slurmdbd would be running.
Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.
<P>
<a id="OPT_AccountingStorageEnforce"></a>
<DT><B>AccountingStorageEnforce</B><DD>
This controls what level of association-based enforcement to impose
on job submissions.  Valid options are any combination of
<I>associations</I>, <I>limits</I>, <I>qos</I>, and <I>wckeys</I>, or
<I>all</I> for all things.  If limits, qos, or wckeys are set,
associations will automatically be set.  In addition, if wckeys is
set, TrackWCKey will automatically be set.  By enforcing Associations
no new job is allowed to run unless a corresponding association exists
in the system.  If limits are enforced users can be limited by
association to whatever job size or run time limits are defined.  With
qos and/or wckeys enforced jobs will not be scheduled unless a valid
qos and/or workload characterization key is specified.  When
<B>AccountingStorageEnforce</B> is changed, a restart of the slurmctld
daemon is required (not just a &quot;scontrol reconfig&quot;).
<P>
<a id="OPT_AccountingStorageHost"></a>
<DT><B>AccountingStorageHost</B><DD>
The name of the machine hosting the accounting storage database.
Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.
Also see <B>DefaultStorageHost</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_AccountingStorageLoc"></a>
<DT><B>AccountingStorageLoc</B><DD>
The fully qualified file name where accounting records are written
when the <B>AccountingStorageType</B> is &quot;accounting_storage/filetxt&quot;
or else the name of the database where accounting records are stored when the
<B>AccountingStorageType</B> is a database.
Also see <B>DefaultStorageLoc</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_AccountingStoragePass"></a>
<DT><B>AccountingStoragePass</B><DD>
The password used to gain access to the database to store the
accounting data.  Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored
otherwise.  In the case of SLURM DBD (Database Daemon) with MUNGE
authentication this can be configured to use a MUNGE daemon
specifically configured to provide authentication between clusters
while the default MUNGE daemon provides authentication within a
cluster.  In that case, <B>AccountingStoragePass</B> should specify the
named port to be used for communications with the alternate MUNGE
daemon (e.g.  &quot;/var/run/munge/global.socket.2&quot;). The default value is
NULL.  Also see <B>DefaultStoragePass</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_AccountingStoragePort"></a>
<DT><B>AccountingStoragePort</B><DD>
The listening port of the accounting storage database server.
Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.
Also see <B>DefaultStoragePort</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_AccountingStorageType"></a>
<DT><B>AccountingStorageType</B><DD>
The accounting storage mechanism type.  Acceptable values at
present include &quot;accounting_storage/filetxt&quot;,
&quot;accounting_storage/mysql&quot;, &quot;accounting_storage/none&quot;,
&quot;accounting_storage/pgsql&quot;, and &quot;accounting_storage/slurmdbd&quot;.  The
&quot;accounting_storage/filetxt&quot; value indicates that accounting records
will be written to the file specified by the
<B>AccountingStorageLoc</B> parameter.  The &quot;accounting_storage/mysql&quot;
value indicates that accounting records will be written to a MySQL
database specified by the <B>AccountingStorageLoc</B> parameter.  The
&quot;accounting_storage/pgsql&quot; value indicates that accounting records
will be written to a PostgreSQL database specified by the
<B>AccountingStorageLoc</B> parameter.  The
&quot;accounting_storage/slurmdbd&quot; value indicates that accounting records
will be written to the SLURM DBD, which manages an underlying MySQL or
PostgreSQL database. See &quot;man slurmdbd&quot; for more information.  The
default value is &quot;accounting_storage/none&quot; and indicates that account
records are not maintained.  Note: the PostgreSQL plugin is not
complete and should not be used if wanting to use associations.  It
will however work with basic accounting of jobs and job steps.  If
interested in completing, please email <A HREF="mailto:slurm-dev@lists.llnl.gov">slurm-dev@lists.llnl.gov</A>.  Also
see <B>DefaultStorageType</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_AccountingStorageUser"></a>
<DT><B>AccountingStorageUser</B><DD>
The user account for accessing the accounting storage database.
Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.
Also see <B>DefaultStorageUser</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_AccountingStoreJobComment"></a>
<DT><B>AccountingStoreJobComment</B><DD>
If set to &quot;YES&quot; then include the job's comment field in the job
complete message sent to the Accounting Storage database.  The default
is &quot;YES&quot;.
<P>
<a id="OPT_AuthType"></a>
<DT><B>AuthType</B><DD>
The authentication method for communications between SLURM
components.
Acceptable values at present include &quot;auth/none&quot;, &quot;auth/authd&quot;,
and &quot;auth/munge&quot;.
The default value is &quot;auth/munge&quot;.
&quot;auth/none&quot; includes the UID in each communication, but it is not verified.
This may be fine for testing purposes, but
<B>do not use &quot;auth/none&quot; if you desire any security</B>.
&quot;auth/authd&quot; indicates that Brett Chun's authd is to be used (see
&quot;<A HREF="http://www.theether.org/authd/">http://www.theether.org/authd/</A>&quot; for more information. Note that
authd is no longer actively supported).
&quot;auth/munge&quot; indicates that LLNL's MUNGE is to be used
(this is the best supported authentication mechanism for SLURM,
see &quot;<A HREF="http://munge.googlecode.com/">http://munge.googlecode.com/</A>&quot; for more information).
All SLURM daemons and commands must be terminated prior to changing
the value of <B>AuthType</B> and later restarted (SLURM jobs can be
preserved).
<P>
<a id="OPT_BackupAddr"></a>
<DT><B>BackupAddr</B><DD>
The name that <B>BackupController</B> should be referred to in
establishing a communications path. This name will
be used as an argument to the gethostbyname() function for
identification. For example, &quot;elx0000&quot; might be used to designate
the Ethernet address for node &quot;lx0000&quot;.
By default the <B>BackupAddr</B> will be identical in value to
<B>BackupController</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_BackupController"></a>
<DT><B>BackupController</B><DD>
The name of the machine where SLURM control functions are to be
executed in the event that <B>ControlMachine</B> fails. This node
may also be used as a compute server if so desired. It will come into service
as a controller only upon the failure of ControlMachine and will revert
to a &quot;standby&quot; mode when the ControlMachine becomes available once again.
This should be a node name without the full domain name.   I.e., the hostname
returned by the <I>gethostname()</I> function cut at the first dot (e.g. use
&quot;tux001&quot; rather than &quot;tux001.my.com&quot;).
While not essential, it is recommended that you specify a backup controller.
See  the <B>RELOCATING CONTROLLERS</B> section if you change this.
<P>
<a id="OPT_BatchStartTimeout"></a>
<DT><B>BatchStartTimeout</B><DD>
The maximum time (in seconds) that a batch job is permitted for
launching before being considered missing and releasing the
allocation. The default value is 10 (seconds). Larger values may be
required if more time is required to execute the <B>Prolog</B>, load
user environment variables (for Moab spawned jobs), or if the slurmd
daemon gets paged from memory.
<P>
<a id="OPT_CacheGroups"></a>
<DT><B>CacheGroups</B><DD>
If set to 1, the slurmd daemon will cache /etc/groups entries.
This can improve performance for highly parallel jobs if NIS servers
are used and unable to respond very quickly.
The default value is 0 to disable caching group data.
<P>
<a id="OPT_CheckpointType"></a>
<DT><B>CheckpointType</B><DD>
The system-initiated checkpoint method to be used for user jobs.
The slurmctld daemon must be restarted for a change in <B>CheckpointType</B>
to take effect.
Supported values presently include:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<a id="OPT_checkpoint/aix"></a>
<DT><B>checkpoint/aix</B><DD>
for AIX systems only
<a id="OPT_checkpoint/blcr"></a>
<DT><B>checkpoint/blcr</B><DD>
Berkeley Lab Checkpoint Restart (BLCR).
NOTE: If a file is found at sbin/scch (relative to the SLURM installation
location), it will be executed upon completion of the checkpoint. This can
be a script used for managing the checkpoint files.
<a id="OPT_checkpoint/none"></a>
<DT><B>checkpoint/none</B><DD>
no checkpoint support (default)
<a id="OPT_checkpoint/ompi"></a>
<DT><B>checkpoint/ompi</B><DD>
OpenMPI (version 1.3 or higher)
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
<a id="OPT_ClusterName"></a>
<DT><B>ClusterName</B><DD>
The name by which this SLURM managed cluster is known in the
accounting database.  This is needed distinguish accounting records
when multiple clusters report to the same database.
<P>
<a id="OPT_CompleteWait"></a>
<DT><B>CompleteWait</B><DD>
The time, in seconds, given for a job to remain in COMPLETING state
before any additional jobs are scheduled.
If set to zero, pending jobs will be started as soon as possible.
Since a COMPLETING job's resources are released for use by other
jobs as soon as the <B>Epilog</B> completes on each individual node,
this can result in very fragmented resource allocations.
To provide jobs with the minimum response time, a value of zero is
recommended (no waiting).
To minimize fragmentation of resources, a value equal to <B>KillWait</B>
plus two is recommended.
In that case, setting <B>KillWait</B> to a small value may be beneficial.
The default value of <B>CompleteWait</B> is zero seconds.
The value may not exceed 65533.
<P>
<a id="OPT_ControlAddr"></a>
<DT><B>ControlAddr</B><DD>
Name that <B>ControlMachine</B> should be referred to in
establishing a communications path. This name will
be used as an argument to the gethostbyname() function for
identification. For example, &quot;elx0000&quot; might be used to designate
the Ethernet address for node &quot;lx0000&quot;.
By default the <B>ControlAddr</B> will be identical in value to
<B>ControlMachine</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_ControlMachine"></a>
<DT><B>ControlMachine</B><DD>
The short hostname of the machine where SLURM control functions are
executed (i.e. the name returned by the command &quot;hostname -s&quot;, use
&quot;tux001&quot; rather than &quot;tux001.my.com&quot;).
This value must be specified.
In order to support some high availability architectures, multiple
hostnames may be listed with comma separators and one <B>ControlAddr</B>
must be specified. The high availability system must insure that the
slurmctld daemon is running on only one of these hosts at a time.
See the <B>RELOCATING CONTROLLERS</B> section if you change this.
<P>
<a id="OPT_CryptoType"></a>
<DT><B>CryptoType</B><DD>
The cryptographic signature tool to be used in the creation of
job step credentials.
The slurmctld daemon must be restarted for a change in <B>CryptoType</B>
to take effect.
Acceptable values at present include &quot;crypto/munge&quot; and &quot;crypto/openssl&quot;.
The default value is &quot;crypto/munge&quot;.
<P>
<a id="OPT_DebugFlags"></a>
<DT><B>DebugFlags</B><DD>
Defines specific subsystems which should provide more detailed event logging.
Multiple subsystems can be specified with comma separators.

<a id="OPT_DefMemPerCPU"></a>
<DT><B>DefMemPerCPU</B><DD>
Default real memory size available per allocated CPU in MegaBytes.
Used to avoid over-subscribing memory and causing paging.
<B>DefMemPerCPU</B> would generally be used if individual processors
are allocated to jobs (<B>SelectType=select/cons_res</B>).
The default value is 0 (unlimited).
Also see <B>DefMemPerNode</B> and <B>MaxMemPerCPU</B>.
<B>DefMemPerCPU</B> and <B>DefMemPerNode</B> are mutually exclusive.
NOTE: Enforcement of memory limits currently requires enabling of
accounting, which samples memory use on a periodic basis (data need
not be stored, just collected).
<P>
<a id="OPT_DefMemPerNode"></a>
<DT><B>DefMemPerNode</B><DD>
Default real memory size available per allocated node in MegaBytes.
Used to avoid over-subscribing memory and causing paging.
<B>DefMemPerNode</B> would generally be used if whole nodes
are allocated to jobs (<B>SelectType=select/linear</B>) and
resources are shared (<B>Shared=yes</B> or <B>Shared=force</B>).
The default value is 0 (unlimited).
Also see <B>DefMemPerCPU</B> and <B>MaxMemPerNode</B>.
<B>DefMemPerCPU</B> and <B>DefMemPerNode</B> are mutually exclusive.
NOTE: Enforcement of memory limits currently requires enabling of
accounting, which samples memory use on a periodic basis (data need
not be stored, just collected).
<P>
<a id="OPT_DefaultStorageHost"></a>
<DT><B>DefaultStorageHost</B><DD>
The default name of the machine hosting the accounting storage and
job completion databases.
Only used for database type storage plugins and when the
<B>AccountingStorageHost</B> and <B>JobCompHost</B> have not been
defined.
<P>
<a id="OPT_DefaultStorageLoc"></a>
<DT><B>DefaultStorageLoc</B><DD>
The fully qualified file name where accounting records and/or job
completion records are written when the <B>DefaultStorageType</B> is
&quot;filetxt&quot; or the name of the database where accounting records and/or job
completion records are stored when the <B>DefaultStorageType</B> is a
database.
Also see <B>AccountingStorageLoc</B> and <B>JobCompLoc</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_DefaultStoragePass"></a>
<DT><B>DefaultStoragePass</B><DD>
The password used to gain access to the database to store the
accounting and job completion data.
Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.
Also see <B>AccountingStoragePass</B> and <B>JobCompPass</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_DefaultStoragePort"></a>
<DT><B>DefaultStoragePort</B><DD>
The listening port of the accounting storage and/or job completion
database server.
Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.
Also see <B>AccountingStoragePort</B> and <B>JobCompPort</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_DefaultStorageType"></a>
<DT><B>DefaultStorageType</B><DD>
The accounting and job completion storage mechanism type.  Acceptable
values at present include &quot;filetxt&quot;, &quot;mysql&quot;, &quot;none&quot;, &quot;pgsql&quot;, and
&quot;slurmdbd&quot;.  The value &quot;filetxt&quot; indicates that records will be
written to a file.  The value &quot;mysql&quot; indicates that accounting
records will be written to a mysql database.  The default value is
&quot;none&quot;, which means that records are not maintained.  The value
&quot;pgsql&quot; indicates that records will be written to a PostgreSQL
database.  The value &quot;slurmdbd&quot; indicates that records will be written
to the SLURM DBD, which maintains its own database. See &quot;man slurmdbd&quot;
for more information.
Also see <B>AccountingStorageType</B> and <B>JobCompType</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_DefaultStorageUser"></a>
<DT><B>DefaultStorageUser</B><DD>
The user account for accessing the accounting storage and/or job
completion database.
Only used for database type storage plugins, ignored otherwise.
Also see <B>AccountingStorageUser</B> and <B>JobCompUser</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_DisableRootJobs"></a>
<DT><B>DisableRootJobs</B><DD>
If set to &quot;YES&quot; then user root will be prevented from running any jobs.
The default value is &quot;NO&quot;, meaning user root will be able to execute jobs.
<B>DisableRootJobs</B> may also be set by partition.
<P>
<a id="OPT_EnforcePartLimits"></a>
<DT><B>EnforcePartLimits</B><DD>
If set to &quot;YES&quot; then jobs which exceed a partition's size and/or time limits
will be rejected at submission time. If set to &quot;NO&quot; then the job will be
accepted and remain queued until the partition limits are altered.
The default value is &quot;NO&quot;.
NOTE: If set, then a job's QOS can not be used to exceed partition limits.
<P>
<a id="OPT_Epilog"></a>
<DT><B>Epilog</B><DD>
Fully qualified pathname of a script to execute as user root on every
node when a user's job completes (e.g. &quot;/usr/local/slurm/epilog&quot;). This may
be used to purge files, disable user login, etc.
By default there is no epilog.
See <B>Prolog and Epilog Scripts</B> for more information.
<P>
<a id="OPT_EpilogMsgTime"></a>
<DT><B>EpilogMsgTime</B><DD>
The number of microseconds that the slurmctld daemon requires to process
an epilog completion message from the slurmd dameons. This parameter can
be used to prevent a burst of epilog completion messages from being sent
at the same time which should help prevent lost messages and improve
throughput for large jobs.
The default value is 2000 microseconds.
For a 1000 node job, this spreads the epilog completion messages out over
two seconds.
<P>
<a id="OPT_EpilogSlurmctld"></a>
<DT><B>EpilogSlurmctld</B><DD>
Fully qualified pathname of a program for the slurmctld to execute
upon termination of a job allocation (e.g.
&quot;/usr/local/slurm/epilog_controller&quot;).
The program executes as SlurmUser, which gives it permission to drain
nodes and requeue the job if a failure occurs or cancel the job if appropriate.
The program can be used to reboot nodes or perform other work to prepare
resources for use.
See <B>Prolog and Epilog Scripts</B> for more information.
<P>
<a id="OPT_FastSchedule"></a>
<DT><B>FastSchedule</B><DD>
Controls how a node's configuration specifications in slurm.conf are used.
If the number of node configuration entries in the configuration file
is significantly lower than the number of nodes, setting FastSchedule to
1 will permit much faster scheduling decisions to be made.
(The scheduler can just check the values in a few configuration records
instead of possibly thousands of node records.)
Note that on systems with hyper-threading, the processor count
reported by the node will be twice the actual processor count.
Consider which value you want to be used for scheduling purposes.
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<a id="OPT_1"></a>
<DT><B>1</B> (default)<DD>
Consider the configuration of each node to be that specified in the
slurm.conf configuration file and any node with less than the
configured resources will be set DOWN.
<a id="OPT_0"></a>
<DT><B>0</B><DD>
Base scheduling decisions upon the actual configuration of each individual
node except that the node's processor count in SLURM's configuration must
match the actual hardware configuration if <B>SchedulerType=sched/gang</B>
or <B>SelectType=select/cons_res</B> are configured (both of those plugins
maintain resource allocation information using bitmaps for the cores in the
system and must remain static, while the node's memory and disk space can
be established later).
<a id="OPT_2"></a>
<DT><B>2</B><DD>
Consider the configuration of each node to be that specified in the
slurm.conf configuration file and any node with less than the
configured resources will <B>not</B> be set DOWN.
This can be useful for testing purposes.
</DL>
</DL>

<P>
<a id="OPT_FirstJobId"></a>
<DT><B>FirstJobId</B><DD>
The job id to be used for the first submitted to SLURM without a
specific requested value. Job id values generated will incremented by 1
for each subsequent job. This may be used to provide a meta-scheduler
with a job id space which is disjoint from the interactive jobs.
The default value is 1.
Also see <B>MaxJobId</B>
<P>
<a id="OPT_GetEnvTimeout"></a>
<DT><B>GetEnvTimeout</B><DD>
Used for Moab scheduled jobs only. Controls how long job should wait
in seconds for loading the user's environment before attempting to
load it from a cache file. Applies when the srun or sbatch
<I>--get-user-env</I> option is used. If set to 0 then always load
the user's environment from the cache file.
The default value is 2 seconds.
<P>
<a id="OPT_GresTypes"></a>
<DT><B>GresTypes</B><DD>
A comma delimited list of generic resources to be managed.
These generic resources may have an associated plugin available to provide

<a id="OPT_GroupUpdateForce"></a>
<DT><B>GroupUpdateForce</B><DD>
If set to a non-zero value, then information about which users are members
of groups allowed to use a partition will be updated periodically, even when
there have been no changes to the /etc/group file.
Otherwise group member information will be updated periodically only after the
/etc/group file is updated
The default vaue is 0.
Also see the <B>GroupUpdateTime</B> parameter.
<P>
<a id="OPT_GroupUpdateTime"></a>
<DT><B>GroupUpdateTime</B><DD>
Controls how frequently information about which users are members of groups
allowed to use a partition will be updated.
The time interval is given in seconds with a default value of 600 seconds and
a maximum value of 4095 seconds.
A value of zero will prevent periodic updating of group membership information.
Also see the <B>GroupUpdateForce</B> parameter.
<P>
<a id="OPT_HealthCheckInterval"></a>
<DT><B>HealthCheckInterval</B><DD>
The interval in seconds between executions of <B>HealthCheckProgram</B>.
The default value is zero, which disables execution.
<P>
<a id="OPT_HealthCheckProgram"></a>
<DT><B>HealthCheckProgram</B><DD>
Fully qualified pathname of a script to execute as user root periodically
on all compute nodes that are not in the NOT_RESPONDING state. This may be
used to verify the node is fully operational and DRAIN the node or send email
if a problem is detected.
Any action to be taken must be explicitly performed by the program
(e.g. execute
&quot;scontrol update NodeName=foo State=drain Reason=tmp_file_system_full&quot;
to drain a node).
The interval is controlled using the <B>HealthCheckInterval</B> parameter.
Note that the <B>HealthCheckProgram</B> will be executed at the same time
on all nodes to minimize its impact upon parallel programs.
This program is will be killed if it does not terminate normally within
60 seconds.
By default, no program will be executed.
<P>
<a id="OPT_InactiveLimit"></a>
<DT><B>InactiveLimit</B><DD>
The interval, in seconds, after which a non-responsive job allocation
command (e.g. <B>srun</B> or <B>salloc</B>) will result in the job being
terminated. If the node on which the command is executed fails or the
command abnormally terminates, this will terminate its job allocation.
This option has no effect upon batch jobs.
When setting a value, take into consideration that a debugger using <B>srun</B>
to launch an application may leave the <B>srun</B> command in a stopped state
for extended periods of time.
This limit is ignored for jobs running in partitions with the
<B>RootOnly</B> flag set (the scheduler running as root will be
responsible for the job).
The default value is unlimited (zero) and may not exceed 65533 seconds.
<P>
<a id="OPT_JobAcctGatherType"></a>
<DT><B>JobAcctGatherType</B><DD>
The job accounting mechanism type.
Acceptable values at present include &quot;jobacct_gather/aix&quot; (for AIX operating
system), &quot;jobacct_gather/linux&quot; (for Linux operating system) and &quot;jobacct_gather/none&quot;
(no accounting data collected).
The default value is &quot;jobacct_gather/none&quot;.
In order to use the <B>sstat</B> tool, &quot;jobacct_gather/aix&quot; or &quot;jobacct_gather/linux&quot;
must be configured.
<P>
<a id="OPT_JobAcctGatherFrequency"></a>
<DT><B>JobAcctGatherFrequency</B><DD>
The job accounting sampling interval.
For jobacct_gather/none this parameter is ignored.
For  jobacct_gather/aix and jobacct_gather/linux the parameter is a number is
seconds between sampling job state.
The default value is 30 seconds.
A value of zero disables real the periodic job sampling and provides accounting
information only on job termination (reducing SLURM interference with the job).
Smaller (non-zero) values have a greater impact upon job performance, but
a value of 30 seconds is not likely to be noticeable for applications having
less than 10,000 tasks.
Users can override this value on a per job basis using the <B>--acctg-freq</B>
option when submitting the job.
<P>
<a id="OPT_JobCheckpointDir"></a>
<DT><B>JobCheckpointDir</B><DD>
Specifies the default directory for storing or reading job checkpoint
information. The data stored here is only a few thousand bytes per job
and includes information needed to resubmit the job request, not job's
memory image. The directory must be readable and writable by
<B>SlurmUser</B>, but not writable by regular users. The job memory images
may be in a different location as specified by <B>--checkpoint-dir</B>
option at job submit time or scontrol's <B>ImageDir</B> option.

Acceptable values at present include &quot;jobcomp/none&quot;, &quot;jobcomp/filetxt&quot;,
&quot;jobcomp/mysql&quot;, &quot;jobcomp/pgsql&quot;, and &quot;jobcomp/script&quot;&quot;.
The default value is &quot;jobcomp/none&quot;, which means that upon job completion
the record of the job is purged from the system.  If using the accounting
infrastructure this plugin may not be of interest since the information
here is redundant.
The value &quot;jobcomp/filetxt&quot; indicates that a record of the job should be
written to a text file specified by the <B>JobCompLoc</B> parameter.
The value &quot;jobcomp/mysql&quot; indicates that a record of the job should be
written to a mysql database specified by the <B>JobCompLoc</B> parameter.

the existing file.
By default, any existing file is truncated.
<P>
<a id="OPT_JobRequeue"></a>
<DT><B>JobRequeue</B><DD>
This option controls what to do by default after a node failure.
If <B>JobRequeue</B> is set to a value of 1, then any batch job running
on the failed node will be requeued for execution on different nodes.
If <B>JobRequeue</B> is set to a value of 0, then any job running
on the failed node will be terminated.
Use the <B>sbatch</B> <I>--no-requeue</I> or <I>--requeue</I>
option to change the default behavior for individual jobs.
The default value is 1.
<P>
<a id="OPT_JobSubmitPlugins"></a>
<DT><B>JobSubmitPlugins</B><DD>
A comma delimited list of job submission plugins to be used.
The specified plugins will be executed in the order listed.
These are intended to be site-specific plugins which can be used to set
default job parameters and/or logging events.
Sample plugins available in the distribution include &quot;cnode&quot;, &quot;defaults&quot;,
&quot;logging&quot;, &quot;lua&quot;, and &quot;partition&quot;.
For examples of use, see the SLURM code in &quot;src/plugins/job_submit&quot; and
&quot;contribs/lua/job_submit*.lua&quot; then modify the code to satisfy your needs.
No job submission plugins are used by default.
<P>
<a id="OPT_KillOnBadExit"></a>
<DT><B>KillOnBadExit</B><DD>
If set to 1, the job will be terminated immediately when one of the
processes is crashed or aborted. With the default value of 0, if one of
the processes is crashed or aborted the other processes will continue

nodes of the cluster) which can be allocated to jobs.
License names can optionally be followed by an asterisk
and count with a default count of one.
Multiple license names should be comma separated (e.g.
&quot;Licenses=foo*4,bar&quot;).
Note that SLURM prevents jobs from being scheduled if their
required license specification is not available.
SLURM does not prevent jobs from using licenses that are
not explicitly listed in the job submission specification.
<P>
<a id="OPT_MailProg"></a>
<DT><B>MailProg</B><DD>
Fully qualified pathname to the program used to send email per user request.

<P>
<a id="OPT_MaxJobCount"></a>
<DT><B>MaxJobCount</B><DD>
The maximum number of jobs SLURM can have in its active database
at one time. Set the values of <B>MaxJobCount</B> and <B>MinJobAge</B>
to insure the slurmctld daemon does not exhaust its memory or other
resources. Once this limit is reached, requests to submit additional
jobs will fail. The default value is 10000 jobs. This value may not
be reset via &quot;scontrol reconfig&quot;. It only takes effect upon restart
of the slurmctld daemon.
<P>
<a id="OPT_MaxJobId"></a>
<DT><B>MaxJobId</B><DD>
The maximum job id to be used for jobs submitted to SLURM without a

The default value is 4294901760 (0xffff0000).
Also see <B>FirstJobId</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_MaxMemPerCPU"></a>
<DT><B>MaxMemPerCPU</B><DD>
Maximum real memory size available per allocated CPU in MegaBytes.
Used to avoid over-subscribing memory and causing paging.
<B>MaxMemPerCPU</B> would generally be used if individual processors
are allocated to jobs (<B>SelectType=select/cons_res</B>).
The default value is 0 (unlimited).
Also see <B>DefMemPerCPU</B> and <B>MaxMemPerNode</B>.
<B>MaxMemPerCPU</B> and <B>MaxMemPerNode</B> are mutually exclusive.
NOTE: Enforcement of memory limits currently requires enabling of
accounting, which samples memory use on a periodic basis (data need
not be stored, just collected).
<P>
<a id="OPT_MaxMemPerNode"></a>
<DT><B>MaxMemPerNode</B><DD>
Maximum real memory size available per allocated node in MegaBytes.
Used to avoid over-subscribing memory and causing paging.

<P>
<a id="OPT_MessageTimeout"></a>
<DT><B>MessageTimeout</B><DD>
Time permitted for a round-trip communication to complete
in seconds. Default value is 10 seconds. For systems with
shared nodes, the slurmd daemon could be paged out and
necessitate higher values.
<P>
<a id="OPT_MinJobAge"></a>
<DT><B>MinJobAge</B><DD>
The minimum age of a completed job before its record is purged from
SLURM's active database. Set the values of <B>MaxJobCount</B> and
<B>MinJobAge</B> to insure the slurmctld daemon does not exhaust
its memory or other resources. The default value is 300 seconds.
A value of zero prevents any job record purging.

<P>
<a id="OPT_OverTimeLimit"></a>
<DT><B>OverTimeLimit</B><DD>
Number of minutes by which a job can exceed its time limit before
being canceled.
The configured job time limit is treated as a <I>soft</I> limit.
Adding <B>OverTimeLimit</B> to the <I>soft</I> limit provides a <I>hard</I>
limit, at which point the job is canceled.
This is particularly useful for backfill scheduling, which bases upon
each job's soft time limit.
The default value is zero.
May not exceed exceed 65533 minutes.
A value of &quot;UNLIMITED&quot; is also supported.
<P>
<a id="OPT_PluginDir"></a>

<P>
<a id="OPT_PreemptMode"></a>
<DT><B>PreemptMode</B><DD>
Enables gang scheduling and/or controls the mechanism used to preempt
jobs.  When the <B>PreemptType</B> parameter is set to enable
preemption, the <B>PreemptMode</B> selects the mechanism used to
preempt the lower priority jobs.  The <B>GANG</B> option is used to
enable gang scheduling independent of whether preemption is enabled
(the <B>PreemptType</B> setting).  The <B>GANG</B> option can be
specified in addition to a <B>PreemptMode</B> setting with the two
options comma separated.  The <B>SUSPEND</B> option requires that gang
scheduling be enabled (i.e, &quot;PreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG&quot;).
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>
<DL COMPACT>
<a id="OPT_OFF"></a>
<DT><B>OFF</B><DD>
is the default value and disables job preemption and gang scheduling.
This is the only option compatible with <B>SchedulerType=sched/wiki</B>

which provide their own job preemption functionality).
<a id="OPT_CANCEL"></a>
<DT><B>CANCEL</B><DD>
always cancel the job.
<a id="OPT_CHECKPOINT"></a>
<DT><B>CHECKPOINT</B><DD>
preempts jobs by checkpointing them (if possible) or canceling them.
<a id="OPT_GANG"></a>
<DT><B>GANG</B><DD>
enables gang scheduling (time slicing) of jobs in the same partition.
NOTE: Gang scheduling is performed independently for each partition, so
configuring partitions with overlapping nodes and gang scheduling is generally
not recommended.
<a id="OPT_REQUEUE"></a>
<DT><B>REQUEUE</B><DD>
preempts jobs by requeuing them (if possible) or canceling them.
<a id="OPT_SUSPEND"></a>
<DT><B>SUSPEND</B><DD>
preempts jobs by suspending them.
A suspended job will resume execution once the high priority job
preempting it completes.
The <B>SUSPEND</B> may only be used with the <B>GANG</B> option
(the gang scheduler module performs the job resume operation)
and with <B>PreemptType=preempt/partition_prio</B> (the logic to 
suspend and resume jobs current only has the data structures to 
support partitions).

Job preemption is based upon partition priority.
Jobs in higher priority partitions (queues) may preempt jobs from lower
priority partitions.
<a id="OPT_preempt/qos"></a>
<DT><B>preempt/qos</B><DD>
Job preemption rules are specified by Quality Of Service (QOS) specifications
in the SLURM database a database.

<P>
<a id="OPT_PriorityDecayHalfLife"></a>
<DT><B>PriorityDecayHalfLife</B><DD>
This controls how long prior resource use is considered in determining
how over- or under-serviced an association is (user, bank account and
cluster) in determining job priority.  If set to 0 no decay will be applied.
This is helpful if you want to enforce hard time limits per association.  If
set to 0 <B>PriorityUsageResetPeriod</B> must be set to some interval.
Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.
The unit is a time string (i.e. min, hr:min:00, days-hr:min:00,
or days-hr).  The default value is 7-0 (7 days).
<P>
<a id="OPT_PriorityCalcPeriod"></a>

<P>
<a id="OPT_PriorityMaxAge"></a>
<DT><B>PriorityMaxAge</B><DD>
Specifies the job age which will be given the maximum age factor in computing
priority. For example, a value of 30 minutes would result in all jobs over
30 minutes old would get the same age-based priority.
Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.
The unit is a time string (i.e. min, hr:min:00, days-hr:min:00,
or days-hr).  The default value is 7-0 (7 days).
<P>
<a id="OPT_PriorityUsageResetPeriod"></a>
<DT><B>PriorityUsageResetPeriod</B><DD>
At this interval the usage of associations will be reset to 0.  This is used
if you want to enforce hard limits of time usage per association.  If
PriorityDecayHalfLife is set to be 0 no decay will happen and this is the
only way to reset the usage accumulated by running jobs.  By default this is
turned off and it is advised to use the PriorityDecayHalfLife option to avoid
not having anything running on your cluster, but if your schema is set up to
only allow certain amounts of time on your system this is the way to do it.
Applicable only if PriorityType=priority/multifactor.

<a id="OPT_ProctrackType"></a>
<DT><B>ProctrackType</B><DD>
Identifies the plugin to be used for process tracking.
The slurmd daemon uses this mechanism to identify all processes
which are children of processes it spawns for a user job.
The slurmd daemon must be restarted for a change in ProctrackType
to take effect.
NOTE: &quot;proctrack/linuxproc&quot; and &quot;proctrack/pgid&quot; can fail to
identify all processes associated with a job since processes
can become a child of the init process (when the parent process
terminates) or change their process group.
To reliably track all processes, one of the other mechanisms
utilizing kernel modifications is preferable.
NOTE: &quot;proctrack/linuxproc&quot; is not compatible with &quot;switch/elan.&quot;

Fully qualified pathname of a program for the slurmd to execute
whenever it is asked to run a job step from a new job allocation (e.g.
&quot;/usr/local/slurm/prolog&quot;).  The slurmd executes the script before starting
the first job step.  This may be used to purge files, enable user login, etc.
By default there is no prolog. Any configured script is expected to
complete execution quickly (in less time than <B>MessageTimeout</B>).
See <B>Prolog and Epilog Scripts</B> for more information.
<P>
<a id="OPT_PrologSlurmctld"></a>

Fully qualified pathname of a program for the slurmctld to execute
before granting a new job allocation (e.g.
&quot;/usr/local/slurm/prolog_controller&quot;).
The program executes as SlurmUser, which gives it permission to drain
nodes and requeue the job if a failure occurs or cancel the job if appropriate.
The program can be used to reboot nodes or perform other work to prepare
resources for use.
While this program is running, the nodes associated with the job will be
have a POWER_UP/CONFIGURING flag set in their state, which can be readily
viewed.
A non-zero exit code will result in the job being requeued (where possible)
or killed.

<P>
<a id="OPT_PropagateResourceLimits"></a>
<DT><B>PropagateResourceLimits</B><DD>
A list of comma separated resource limit names.
The slurmd daemon uses these names to obtain the associated (soft) limit
values from the users process environment on the submit node.
These limits are then propagated and applied to the jobs that
will run on the compute nodes.
This parameter can be useful when system limits vary among nodes.
Any resource limits that do not appear in the list are not propagated.
However, the user can override this by specifying which resource limits
to propagate with the srun commands &quot;--propagate&quot; option.
If neither of the 'propagate resource limit' parameters are specified, then
the default action is to propagate all limits.
Only one of the parameters, either
<B>PropagateResourceLimits</B> or <B>PropagateResourceLimitsExcept</B>,
may be specified.
The following limit names are supported by SLURM (although some

<DT><B>PropagateResourceLimitsExcept</B><DD>
A list of comma separated resource limit names.
By default, all resource limits will be propagated, (as described by

<a id="OPT_ResumeProgram"></a>
<DT><B>ResumeProgram</B><DD>
SLURM supports a mechanism to reduce power consumption on nodes that
remain idle for an extended period of time.
This is typically accomplished by reducing voltage and frequency or powering
the node down.
<B>ResumeProgram</B> is the program that will be executed when a node
in power save mode is assigned work to perform.
For reasons of reliability, <B>ResumeProgram</B> may execute more than once
for a node when the <B>slurmctld</B> daemon crashes and is restarted.
If <B>ResumeProgram</B> is unable to restore a node to service, it should
requeue any node associated with the node and set the node state to DRAIN.
The program executes as <B>SlurmUser</B>.
The argument to the program will be the names of nodes to
be removed from power savings mode (using SLURM's hostlist
expression format).
By default no program is run.
Related configuration options include <B>ResumeTimeout</B>, <B>ResumeRate</B>,
<B>SuspendRate</B>, <B>SuspendTime</B>, <B>SuspendTimeout</B>, <B>SuspendProgram</B>,
<B>SuspendExcNodes</B>, and <B>SuspendExcParts</B>.

<a id="OPT_ResumeRate"></a>
<DT><B>ResumeRate</B><DD>
The rate at which nodes in power save mode are returned to normal
operation by <B>ResumeProgram</B>.
The value is number of nodes per minute and it can be used to prevent
power surges if a large number of nodes in power save mode are
assigned work at the same time (e.g. a large job starts).
A value of zero results in no limits being imposed.
The default value is 300 nodes per minute.

The default number of jobs to attempt scheduling (i.e. the queue depth) when a
running job completes or other routine actions occur. The full queue will be
tested on a less frequent basis. The default value is 100.
In the case of large clusters (more than 1000 nodes), configuring a relatively
small value may be desirable.
<a id="OPT_defer"></a>
<DT><B>defer</B><DD>
Setting this option will avoid attempting to schedule each job
individually at job submit time, but defer it until a later time when
scheduling multiple jobs simultaneously may be possible.
This option may improve system responsiveness when large numbers of jobs
(many hundreds) are submitted at the same time, but it will delay the
initiation time of individual jobs. Also see <B>default_queue_depth</B> above.
<a id="OPT_bf_interval=#"></a>
<DT><B>bf_interval=#</B><DD>

<a id="OPT_bf_window=#"></a>
<DT><B>bf_window=#</B><DD>
The number of minutes into the future to look when considering jobs to schedule.
Higher values result in more overhead and less responsiveness.
The default value is 1440 minutes (one day).
This option applies only to <B>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</B>.
<a id="OPT_max_job_bf=#"></a>
<DT><B>max_job_bf=#</B><DD>
The maximum number of jobs to attempt backfill scheduling for
(i.e. the queue depth).
Higher values result in more overhead and less responsiveness.
Until an attempt is made to backfill schedule a job, its expected
initiation time value will not be set.
The default value is 50.
In the case of large clusters (more than 1000 nodes) configured with
<B>SelectType=select/cons_res</B>, configuring a relatively small value may be
desirable.
This option applies only to <B>SchedulerType=sched/backfill</B>.
<a id="OPT_max_switch_wait=#"></a>

<DT><B>SchedulerType</B><DD>
Identifies the type of scheduler to be used.
Note the <B>slurmctld</B> daemon must be restarted for a change in

This is the default.
<a id="OPT_sched/backfill"></a>
<DT><B>sched/backfill</B><DD>
for a backfill scheduling module to augment the default FIFO scheduling.
Backfill scheduling will initiate lower-priority jobs if doing

<a id="OPT_SlurmdPort"></a>
<DT><B>SlurmdPort</B><DD>
The port number that the SLURM compute node daemon, <B>slurmd</B>, listens
to for work. The default value is SLURMD_PORT as established at system
build time. If none is explicitly specified, its value will be 6818.
NOTE: Either slurmctld and slurmd daemons must not execute
on the same nodes or the values of <B>SlurmctldPort</B> and <B>SlurmdPort</B>
must be different.
<P>
<a id="OPT_SlurmdSpoolDir"></a>
<DT><B>SlurmdSpoolDir</B><DD>
Fully qualified pathname of a directory into which the <B>slurmd</B>
daemon's state information and batch job script information are written. This
must be a common pathname for all nodes, but should represent a directory which
is local to each node (reference a local file system). The default value
is &quot;/var/spool/slurmd.&quot; <B>NOTE</B>: This directory is also used to store
<B>slurmd</B>'s
shared memory lockfile, and <B>should not be changed</B> unless the system
is being cleanly restarted. If the location of <B>SlurmdSpoolDir</B> is
changed and <B>slurmd</B> is restarted, the new daemon will attach to a
different shared memory region and lose track of any running jobs.
<P>
<a id="OPT_SlurmdTimeout"></a>
<DT><B>SlurmdTimeout</B><DD>
The interval, in seconds, that the SLURM controller waits for <B>slurmd</B>
to respond before configuring that node's state to DOWN.
A value of zero indicates the node will not be tested by <B>slurmctld</B> to
confirm the state of <B>slurmd</B>, the node will not be automatically set to
a DOWN state indicating a non-responsive <B>slurmd</B>, and some other tool
will take responsibility for monitoring the state of each compute node
and its <B>slurmd</B> daemon.
SLURM's hierarchical communication mechanism is used to ping the <B>slurmd</B>
daemons in order to minimize system noise and overhead.
The default value is 300 seconds.
The value may not exceed 65533 seconds.
<P>
<a id="OPT_SlurmSchedLogFile"></a>
<DT><B>SlurmSchedLogFile</B><DD>
Fully qualified pathname of the scheduling event logging file.

<DT><B>SlurmSchedLogLevel</B><DD>
The initial level of scheduling event logging, similar to the 
<B>SlurmctlDebug</B> parameter used to control the initial level of 
<B>slurmctld</B> logging.  
Valid values for <B>SlurmSchedLogLevel</B> are &quot;0&quot; (scheduler logging 
disabled) and &quot;1&quot; (scheduler logging enabled).  
If this parameter is omitted, the value defaults to &quot;0&quot; (disabled). 
In order to configure scheduler logging, set both the <B>SlurmSchedLogFile</B>

<a id="OPT_SrunEpilog"></a>
<DT><B>SrunEpilog</B><DD>
Fully qualified pathname of an executable to be run by srun following
the completion of a job step.  The command line arguments for the
executable will be the command and arguments of the job step.  This
configuration parameter may be overridden by srun's <B>--epilog</B>
parameter. Note that while the other &quot;Epilog&quot; executables (e.g.,
TaskEpilog) are run by slurmd on the compute nodes where the tasks are
executed, the <B>SrunEpilog</B> runs on the node where the &quot;srun&quot; is
executing.
<P>
<a id="OPT_SrunProlog"></a>
<DT><B>SrunProlog</B><DD>
Fully qualified pathname of an executable to be run by srun prior to
the launch of a job step.  The command line arguments for the
executable will be the command and arguments of the job step.  This
configuration parameter may be overridden by srun's <B>--prolog</B>
parameter. Note that while the other &quot;Prolog&quot; executables (e.g.,
TaskProlog) are run by slurmd on the compute nodes where the tasks are

<a id="OPT_StateSaveLocation"></a>
<DT><B>StateSaveLocation</B><DD>
Fully qualified pathname of a directory into which the SLURM controller,
<B>slurmctld</B>, saves its state (e.g. &quot;/usr/local/slurm/checkpoint&quot;).
SLURM state will saved here to recover from system failures.
<B>SlurmUser</B> must be able to create files in this directory.
If you have a <B>BackupController</B> configured, this location should be
readable and writable by both systems.
Since all running and pending job information is stored here, the use of
a reliable file system (e.g. RAID) is recommended.
The default value is &quot;/tmp&quot;.
If any slurm daemons terminate abnormally, their core files will also be written
into this directory.

<DT><B>SuspendProgram</B><DD>
<B>SuspendProgram</B> is the program that will be executed when a node
remains idle for an extended period of time.
This program is expected to place the node into some power save mode.
This can be used to reduce the frequency and voltage of a node or
completely power the node off.
The program executes as <B>SlurmUser</B>.
The argument to the program will be the names of nodes to
be placed into power savings mode (using SLURM's hostlist
expression format).
By default, no program is run.

<a id="OPT_SuspendRate"></a>
<DT><B>SuspendRate</B><DD>
The rate at which nodes are place into power save mode by <B>SuspendProgram</B>.
The value is number of nodes per minute and it can be used to prevent
a large drop in power power consumption (e.g. after a large job completes).
A value of zero results in no limits being imposed.
The default value is 60 nodes per minute.

&quot;switch/none&quot; for switches not requiring special processing for job launch
or termination (Myrinet, Ethernet, and InfiniBand),
&quot;switch/elan&quot; for Quadrics Elan 3 or Elan 4 interconnect.
The default value is &quot;switch/none&quot;.
All SLURM daemons, commands and running jobs must be restarted for a
change in <B>SwitchType</B> to take effect.
If running jobs exist at the time <B>slurmctld</B> is restarted with a new

<a id="OPT_task/affinity"></a>
<DT><B>task/affinity</B><DD>
enables resource containment using CPUSETs.
This enables the --cpu_bind and/or --mem_bind srun options.
If you use &quot;task/affinity&quot; and encounter problems, it may be due to
the variety of system calls used to implement task affinity on
different operating systems.
If that is the case, you may want to install Portable Linux
Process Affinity (PLPA, see <A HREF="http://www.open-mpi.org/software/plpa),">http://www.open-mpi.org/software/plpa),</A>
which is supported by SLURM.

<a id="OPT_TrackWCKey"></a>
<DT><B>TrackWCKey</B><DD>
Boolean yes or no.  Used to set display and track of the Workload
Characterization Key.  Must be set to track wckey usage.
<P>
<a id="OPT_TreeWidth"></a>
<DT><B>TreeWidth</B><DD>
<B>Slurmd</B> daemons use a virtual tree network for communications.
<B>TreeWidth</B> specifies the width of the tree (i.e. the fanout).
On architectures with a front end node running the slurmd daemon, the value
must always be equal to or greater than the number of front end nodes which
eliminates the need for message forwarding between the slurmd daemons.
On other architectures the default value is 50, meaning each slurmd daemon can
communicate with up to 50 other slurmd daemons and over 2500 nodes can be
contacted with two message hops.
The default value will work well for most clusters.
Optimal system performance can typically be achieved if <B>TreeWidth</B>
is set to the square root of the number of nodes in the cluster for
systems having no more than 2500 nodes or the cube root for larger
systems.

<a id="OPT_UnkillableStepProgram"></a>
<DT><B>UnkillableStepProgram</B><DD>
If the processes in a job step are determined to be unkillable for a period

specified by <B>UnkillableStepProgram</B> will be executed.
This program can be used to take special actions to clean up the unkillable
processes and/or notify computer administrators.
The program will be run <B>SlurmdUser</B> (usually &quot;root&quot;).
By default no program is run.
<P>
<a id="OPT_UnkillableStepTimeout"></a>
<DT><B>UnkillableStepTimeout</B><DD>
The length of time, in seconds, that SLURM will wait before deciding that
processes in a job step are unkillable (after they have been signaled with
SIGKILL) and execute <B>UnkillableStepProgram</B> as described above.
The default timeout value is 60 seconds.
<P>
<a id="OPT_UsePAM"></a>
<DT><B>UsePAM</B><DD>
If set to 1, PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules for Linux) will be enabled.
PAM is used to establish the upper bounds for resource limits. With PAM support
enabled, local system administrators can dynamically configure system resource
limits. Changing the upper bound of a resource limit will not alter the limits
of running jobs, only jobs started after a change has been made will pick up
the new limits.
The default value is 0 (not to enable PAM support).
Remember that PAM also needs to be configured to support SLURM as a service.
For sites using PAM's directory based configuration option, a configuration
file named <B>slurm</B> should be created. The module-type, control-flags, and
module-path names that should be included in the file are:
<BR>

auth        required      pam_localuser.so
<BR>

auth        required      pam_shells.so
<BR>

account     required      pam_unix.so
<BR>

account     required      pam_access.so
<BR>

session     required      pam_unix.so
<BR>

For sites configuring PAM with a general configuration file, the appropriate
lines (see above), where <B>slurm</B> is the service-name, should be added.
<P>
<a id="OPT_VSizeFactor"></a>
<DT><B>VSizeFactor</B><DD>
Memory specifications in job requests apply to real memory size (also known 
as resident set size). It is possible to enforce virtual memory limits for 
both jobs and job steps by limiting their virtual memory to some percentage
of their real memory allocation. The <B>VSizeFactor</B> parameter specifies 
the job's or job step's virtual memory limit as a percentage of its real 
memory limit. For example, if a job's real memory limit is 500MB and 
VSizeFactor is set to 101 then the job will be killed if its real memory
exceeds 500MB or its virtual memory exceeds 505MB (101 percent of the 
real memory limit).
The default valus is 0, which disables enforcement of virtual memory limits.
The value may not exceed 65533 percent.
<P>
<a id="OPT_WaitTime"></a>
<DT><B>WaitTime</B><DD>
Specifies how many seconds the srun command should by default wait after
the first task terminates before terminating all remaining tasks. The
&quot;--wait&quot; option on the srun command line overrides this value.
If set to 0, this feature is disabled.
May not exceed 65533 seconds.
<P>
</DL>
<P>

The configuration of nodes (or machines) to be managed by SLURM is
also specified in <B>/etc/slurm.conf</B>.
Changes in node configuration (e.g. adding nodes, changing their
processor count, etc.) require restarting the slurmctld daemon.
Only the NodeName must be supplied in the configuration file.
All other node configuration information is optional.
It is advisable to establish baseline node configurations,
especially if the cluster is heterogeneous.
Nodes which register to the system with less than the configured resources
(e.g. too little memory), will be placed in the &quot;DOWN&quot; state to
avoid scheduling jobs on them.
Establishing baseline configurations will also speed SLURM's
scheduling process by permitting it to compare job requirements
against these (relatively few) configuration parameters and
possibly avoid having to check job requirements
against every individual node's configuration.
The resources checked at node registration time are: CPUs,
RealMemory and TmpDisk.
While baseline values for each of these can be established
in the configuration file, the actual values upon node
registration are recorded and these actual values may be
used for scheduling purposes (depending upon the value of
<B>FastSchedule</B> in the configuration file.
<P>

Default values can be specified with a record in which
&quot;NodeName&quot; is &quot;DEFAULT&quot;.
The default entry values will apply only to lines following it in the
configuration file and the default values can be reset multiple times
in the configuration file with multiple entries where &quot;NodeName=DEFAULT&quot;.
The &quot;NodeName=&quot; specification must be placed on every line
describing the configuration of nodes.
In fact, it is generally possible and desirable to define the
configurations of all nodes in only a few lines.
This convention permits significant optimization in the scheduling
of larger clusters.
In order to support the concept of jobs requiring consecutive nodes
on some architectures,
node specifications should be place in this file in consecutive order.
No single node name may be listed more than once in the configuration
file.
Use &quot;DownNodes=&quot; to record the state of nodes which are temporarily
in a DOWN, DRAIN or FAILING state without altering permanent
configuration information.
A job step's tasks are allocated to nodes in order the nodes appear
in the configuration file. There is presently no capability within
SLURM to arbitrarily order a job step's tasks.
<P>

Multiple node names may be comma separated (e.g. &quot;alpha,beta,gamma&quot;)
and/or a simple node range expression may optionally be used to
specify numeric ranges of nodes to avoid building a configuration
file with large numbers of entries.
The node range expression can contain one  pair of square brackets
with a sequence of comma separated numbers and/or ranges of numbers
separated by a &quot;-&quot; (e.g. &quot;linux[0-64,128]&quot;, or &quot;lx[15,18,32-33]&quot;).
Note that the numeric ranges can include one or more leading
zeros to indicate the numeric portion has a fixed number of digits
(e.g. &quot;linux[0000-1023]&quot;).
Up to two numeric ranges can be included in the expression
(e.g. &quot;rack[0-63]_blade[0-41]&quot;).
If one or more numeric expressions are included, one of them
must be at the end of the name (e.g. &quot;unit[0-31]rack&quot; is invalid),
but arbitrary names can always be used in a comma separated list.
<P>

On BlueGene systems only, the square brackets should contain
pairs of three digit numbers separated by a &quot;x&quot;.
These numbers indicate the boundaries of a rectangular prism
(e.g. &quot;bgl[000x144,400x544]&quot;).
See BlueGene documentation for more details.
The node configuration specified the following information:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<a id="OPT_NodeName"></a>
<DT><B>NodeName</B><DD>
Name that SLURM uses to refer to a node (or base partition for
BlueGene systems).
Typically this would be the string that &quot;/bin/hostname -s&quot; returns.
It may also be the fully qualified domain name as returned by &quot;/bin/hostname -f&quot;
(e.g. &quot;foo1.bar.com&quot;), or any valid domain name associated with the host
through the host database (/etc/hosts) or DNS, depending on the resolver
settings.  Note that if the short form of the hostname is not used, it
may prevent use of hostlist expressions (the numeric portion in brackets
must be at the end of the string).
Only short hostname forms are compatible with the
switch/elan and switch/federation plugins at this time.
It may also be an arbitrary string if <B>NodeHostname</B> is specified.
If the <B>NodeName</B> is &quot;DEFAULT&quot;, the values specified
with that record will apply to subsequent node specifications
unless explicitly set to other values in that node record or
replaced with a different set of default values.
For architectures in which the node order is significant,
nodes will be considered consecutive in the order defined.
For example, if the configuration for &quot;NodeName=charlie&quot; immediately
follows the configuration for &quot;NodeName=baker&quot; they will be
considered adjacent in the computer.

switch/elan and switch/federation plugins at this time.
A node range expression can be used to specify a set of nodes.
If an expression is used, the number of nodes identified by
<B>NodeHostname</B> on a line in the configuration file must
be identical to the number of nodes identified by <B>NodeName</B>.
By default, the <B>NodeHostname</B> will be identical in value to
<B>NodeName</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_NodeAddr"></a>
<DT><B>NodeAddr</B><DD>
Name that a node should be referred to in establishing
a communications path.
This name will be used as an
argument to the gethostbyname() function for identification.
If a node range expression is used to designate multiple nodes,
they must exactly match the entries in the <B>NodeName</B>
(e.g. &quot;NodeName=lx[0-7] NodeAddr=&quot;elx[0-7]&quot;).
<B>NodeAddr</B> may also contain IP addresses.
By default, the <B>NodeAddr</B> will be identical in value to
<B>NodeName</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_CoresPerSocket"></a>
<DT><B>CoresPerSocket</B><DD>
Number of cores in a single physical processor socket (e.g. &quot;2&quot;).
The CoresPerSocket value describes physical cores, not the
logical number of processors per socket.
<B>NOTE</B>: If you have multi-core processors, you will likely
need to specify this parameter in order to optimize scheduling.
The default value is 1.
<P>
<a id="OPT_CPUs"></a>
<DT><B>CPUs</B><DD>
Number of logical processors on the node (e.g. &quot;2&quot;).
If <B>CPUs</B> is omitted, it will set equal to the product of

The default value is 1.
<P>
<a id="OPT_Feature"></a>
<DT><B>Feature</B><DD>
A comma delimited list of arbitrary strings indicative of some
characteristic associated with the node.
There is no value associated with a feature at this time, a node
either has a feature or it does not.
If desired a feature may contain a numeric component indicating,
for example, processor speed.
By default a node has no features.
Also see <B>Gres</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_Gres"></a>
<DT><B>Gres</B><DD>
A comma delimited list of generic resources specifications for a node.
Each resource specification consists of a name followed by an optional
colon with a numeric value (default value is one)
(e.g. &quot;Gres=bandwidth:10000,gpu:2&quot;).
A suffix of &quot;K&quot;, &quot;M&quot; or &quot;G&quot; may be used to mulitply the number by 1024,
1048576 or 1073741824 respectively (e.g. &quot;Gres=bandwidth:4G,gpu:4&quot;)..
By default a node has no generic resources.
Also see <B>Feature</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_Port"></a>
<DT><B>Port</B><DD>
The port number that the SLURM compute node daemon, <B>slurmd</B>, listens
to for work on this particular node. By default there is a single port number
for all <B>slurmd</B> daemons on all compute nodes as defined by the 
<B>SlurmdPort</B> configuration parameter. Use of this option is not generally
recommended except for development or testing purposes.

Identifies the reason for a node being in state &quot;DOWN&quot;, &quot;DRAINED&quot;
&quot;DRAINING&quot;, &quot;FAIL&quot; or &quot;FAILING&quot;.
Use quotes to enclose a reason having more than one word.
<P>
<a id="OPT_Sockets"></a>
<DT><B>Sockets</B><DD>
Number of physical processor sockets/chips on the node (e.g. &quot;2&quot;).
If Sockets is omitted, it will be inferred from
<B>CPUs</B>, <B>CoresPerSocket</B>, and <B>ThreadsPerCore</B>.
<B>NOTE</B>: If you have multi-core processors, you will likely
need to specify these parameters.
The default value is 1.
<P>
<a id="OPT_State"></a>
<DT><B>State</B><DD>
State of the node with respect to the initiation of user jobs.
Acceptable values are &quot;DOWN&quot;, &quot;DRAIN&quot;, &quot;FAIL&quot;, &quot;FAILING&quot; and &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;.
&quot;DOWN&quot; indicates the node failed and is unavailable to be allocated work.
&quot;DRAIN&quot; indicates the node is unavailable to be allocated work.
&quot;FAIL&quot; indicates the node is expected to fail soon, has
no jobs allocated to it, and will not be allocated
to any new jobs.
&quot;FAILING&quot; indicates the node is expected to fail soon, has
one or more jobs allocated to it, but will not be allocated
to any new jobs.
&quot;UNKNOWN&quot; indicates the node's state is undefined (BUSY or IDLE),
but will be established when the <B>slurmd</B> daemon on that node
registers.
The default value is &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;.
Also see the <B>DownNodes</B> parameter below.
<P>
<a id="OPT_ThreadsPerCore"></a>
<DT><B>ThreadsPerCore</B><DD>
Number of logical threads in a single physical core (e.g. &quot;2&quot;).
Note that the SLURM can allocate resources to jobs down to the
resolution of a core. If your system is configured with more than
one thread per core, execution of a different job on each thread
is not supported unless you configure <B>SelectTypeParameters=CR_CPU</B>
plus <B>CPUs</B>; do not configure <B>Sockets</B>, <B>CoresPerSocket</B> or
<B>ThreadsPerCore</B>.
A job can execute a one task per thread from within one job step or
execute a distinct job step on each of the threads.
Note also if you are running with more than 1 thread per core and running
the select/cons_res plugin you will want to set the SelectTypeParameters
variable to something other than CR_CPU to avoid unexpected results.
The default value is 1.
<P>
<a id="OPT_TmpDisk"></a>
<DT><B>TmpDisk</B><DD>
Total size of temporary disk storage in <B>TmpFS</B> in MegaBytes
(e.g. &quot;16384&quot;). <B>TmpFS</B> (for &quot;Temporary File System&quot;)
identifies the location which jobs should use for temporary storage.
Note this does not indicate the amount of free
space available to the user on the node, only the total file
system size. The system administration should insure this file
system is purged as needed so that user jobs have access to
most of this space.
The Prolog and/or Epilog programs (specified in the configuration file)
might be used to insure the file system is kept clean.
The default value is 0.
<P>
<a id="OPT_Weight"></a>
<DT><B>Weight</B><DD>
The priority of the node for scheduling purposes.
All things being equal, jobs will be allocated the nodes with
the lowest weight which satisfies their requirements.
For example, a heterogeneous collection of nodes might
be placed into a single partition for greater system
utilization, responsiveness and capability. It would be
preferable to allocate smaller memory nodes rather than larger
memory nodes if either will satisfy a job's requirements.
The units of weight are arbitrary, but larger weights
should be assigned to nodes with more processors, memory,
disk space, higher processor speed, etc.
Note that if a job allocation request can not be satisfied
using the nodes with the lowest weight, the set of nodes
with the next lowest weight is added to the set of nodes
under consideration for use (repeat as needed for higher
weight values). If you absolutely want to minimize the number
of higher weight nodes allocated to a job (at a cost of higher
scheduling overhead), give each node a distinct <B>Weight</B>
value and they will be added to the pool of nodes being
considered for scheduling individually.
The default value is 1.

On computers where frontend nodes are used to execute batch scripts
rather than compute nodes (BlueGene or Cray systems), one may
configure one or more frontend nodes using the configuration parameters
defined below. These options are very similar to those used in configuring
compute nodes. These options may only be used on systems configured and built
with the appropriate parameters (--have-front-end,
--enable-bluegene-emulation) or a system determined to have the
appropriate architecture by the configure script (BlueGene or Cray systems).
The front end configuration specifies the following information:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<a id="OPT_FrontendName"></a>
<DT><B>FrontendName</B><DD>
Name that SLURM uses to refer to a frontend node.
Typically this would be the string that &quot;/bin/hostname -s&quot; returns.
It may also be the fully qualified domain name as returned by &quot;/bin/hostname -f&quot;
(e.g. &quot;foo1.bar.com&quot;), or any valid domain name associated with the host
through the host database (/etc/hosts) or DNS, depending on the resolver
settings.  Note that if the short form of the hostname is not used, it
may prevent use of hostlist expressions (the numeric portion in brackets
must be at the end of the string).
If the <B>FrontendName</B> is &quot;DEFAULT&quot;, the values specified
with that record will apply to subsequent node specifications
unless explicitly set to other values in that frontend node record or
replaced with a different set of default values.
Note that since the naming of front end nodes would typically not follow that
of the compute nodes (e.g. lacking X, Y and Z coordinates found in the compute
node naming scheme), each front end node name should be listed separately and
without a hostlist expression (i.e. frontend00,frontend01&quot; rather than
&quot;frontend[00-01]&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
<P>
<a id="OPT_FrontendAddr"></a>
<DT><B>FrontendAddr</B><DD>
Name that a frontend node should be referred to in establishing
a communications path. This name will be used as an
argument to the gethostbyname() function for identification.
As with <B>FrontendName</B>, list the individual node addresses rather than
using a hostlist expression.
The number of <B>FrontendAddr</B> records per line must equal the number of
<B>FrontendName</B> records per line (i.e. you can't map to node names to
one address).
<B>FrontendAddr</B> may also contain IP addresses.
By default, the <B>FrontendAddr</B> will be identical in value to
<B>FrontendName</B>.
<P>
<a id="OPT_Port"></a>
<DT><B>Port</B><DD>
The port number that the SLURM compute node daemon, <B>slurmd</B>, listens
to for work on this particular frontend node. By default there is a single port
number for all <B>slurmd</B> daemons on all frontend nodes as defined by the
<B>SlurmdPort</B> configuration parameter. Use of this option is not generally
recommended except for development or testing purposes.
<P>
<a id="OPT_Reason"></a>
<DT><B>Reason</B><DD>
Identifies the reason for a frontend node being in state &quot;DOWN&quot;, &quot;DRAINED&quot;
&quot;DRAINING&quot;, &quot;FAIL&quot; or &quot;FAILING&quot;.
Use quotes to enclose a reason having more than one word.
<P>
<a id="OPT_State"></a>
<DT><B>State</B><DD>
State of the frontend node with respect to the initiation of user jobs.
Acceptable values are &quot;DOWN&quot;, &quot;DRAIN&quot;, &quot;FAIL&quot;, &quot;FAILING&quot; and &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;.
&quot;DOWN&quot; indicates the frontend node has failed and is unavailable to be
allocated work.
&quot;DRAIN&quot; indicates the frontend node is unavailable to be allocated work.
&quot;FAIL&quot; indicates the frontend node is expected to fail soon, has
no jobs allocated to it, and will not be allocated to any new jobs.
&quot;FAILING&quot; indicates the frontend node is expected to fail soon, has
one or more jobs allocated to it, but will not be allocated to any new jobs.
&quot;UNKNOWN&quot; indicates the frontend node's state is undefined (BUSY or IDLE),
but will be established when the <B>slurmd</B> daemon on that node registers.
The default value is &quot;UNKNOWN&quot;.
Also see the <B>DownNodes</B> parameter below.

The partition configuration permits you to establish different job
limits or access controls for various groups (or partitions) of nodes.
Nodes may be in more than one partition, making partitions serve
as general purpose queues.
For example one may put the same set of nodes into two different
partitions, each with different constraints (time limit, job sizes,
groups allowed to use the partition, etc.).
Jobs are allocated resources within a single partition.
Default values can be specified with a record in which
&quot;PartitionName&quot; is &quot;DEFAULT&quot;.
The default entry values will apply only to lines following it in the
configuration file and the default values can be reset multiple times
in the configuration file with multiple entries where &quot;PartitionName=DEFAULT&quot;.
The &quot;PartitionName=&quot; specification must be placed on every line
describing the configuration of partitions.
If a partition that is in use is deleted from the configuration and slurm
is restarted or reconfigured (scontrol reconfigure), jobs using the partition
are canceled.
<B>NOTE:</B> Put all parameters for each partition on a single line.
Each line of partition configuration information should
represent a different partition.
The partition configuration file contains the following information:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<a id="OPT_AllocNodes"></a>
<DT><B>AllocNodes</B><DD>
Comma separated list of nodes from which users can execute jobs in the
partition.
Node names may be specified using the node range expression syntax
described above.
The default value is &quot;ALL&quot;.
<P>
<a id="OPT_AllowGroups"></a>
<DT><B>AllowGroups</B><DD>
Comma separated list of group names which may execute jobs in the partition.
If at least one group associated with the user attempting to execute the
job is in AllowGroups, he will be permitted to use this partition.
Jobs executed as user root can use any partition without regard to
the value of AllowGroups.
If user root attempts to execute a job as another user (e.g. using
srun's --uid option), this other user must be in one of groups
identified by AllowGroups for the job to successfully execute.
The default value is &quot;ALL&quot;.
<B>NOTE:</B> For performance reasons, SLURM maintains a list of user IDs
allowed to use each partition and this is checked at job submission time.
This list of user IDs is updated when the <B>slurmctld</B> daemon is restarted,
reconfigured (e.g. &quot;scontrol reconfig&quot;) or the partition's <B>AllowGroups</B>
value is reset, even if is value is unchanged
(e.g. &quot;scontrol update PartitionName=name AllowGroups=group&quot;).
For a user's access to a partition to change, both his group membership must
change and SLURM's internal user ID list must change using one of the methods
described above.
<P>
<a id="OPT_Alternate"></a>
<DT><B>Alternate</B><DD>

Specifies if only user ID zero (i.e. user <I>root</I>) may allocate resources
in this partition. User root may allocate resources for any other user,
but the request must be initiated by user root.
This option can be useful for a partition to be managed by some
external entity (e.g. a higher-level job manager) and prevents
users from directly using those resources.

<DT><B>Shared</B><DD>
Controls the ability of the partition to execute more than one job at a
time on each resource (node, socket or core depending upon the value
of <B>SelectTypeParameters</B>).
If resources are to be shared, avoiding memory over-subscription
is very important.
<B>SelectTypeParameters</B> should be configured to treat
memory as a consumable resource and the <B>--mem</B> option
should be used for job allocations.
Sharing of resources is typically useful only when using gang scheduling
(<B>PreemptMode=suspend</B> or <B>PreemptMode=kill</B>).
Possible values for <B>Shared</B> are &quot;EXCLUSIVE&quot;, &quot;FORCE&quot;, &quot;YES&quot;, and &quot;NO&quot;.

<a id="SECTION_Prolog and Epilog Scripts"></a>
<H2>Prolog and Epilog Scripts</H2>

There are a variety of prolog and epilog program options that
execute with various permissions and at various times.
The four options most likely to be used are:
<B>Prolog</B> and <B>Epilog</B> (executed once on each compute node
for each job) plus <B>PrologSlurmctld</B> and <B>EpilogSlurmctld</B>
(executed once on the <B>ControlMachine</B> for each job).
<P>
NOTE:  Standard output and error messages are normally not preserved.
Explicitly write output and error messages to an appropriate location
if you wish to preserve that information.
<P>
NOTE:  The Prolog script is ONLY run on any individual
node when it first sees a job step from a new allocation; it does not
run the Prolog immediately when an allocation is granted.  If no job steps
from an allocation are run on a node, it will never run the Prolog for that
allocation.  The Epilog, on the other hand, always runs on every node of an
allocation when the allocation is released.
<P>
Information about the job is passed to the script using environment
variables.
Unless otherwise specified, these environment variables are available
to all of the programs.

<a id="SECTION_NETWORK TOPOLOGY"></a>
<H2>NETWORK TOPOLOGY</H2>

SLURM is able to optimize job allocations to minimize network contention.
Special SLURM logic is used to optimize allocations on systems with a
three-dimensional interconnect (BlueGene, Sun Constellation, etc.)
and information about configuring those systems are available on
web pages available here: &lt;<A HREF="http://www.schedmd.com/slurmdocs/">http://www.schedmd.com/slurmdocs/</A>&gt;.
For a hierarchical network, SLURM needs to have detailed information
about how nodes are configured on the network switches.
<P>

Given network topology information, SLURM allocates all of a job's
resources onto a single leaf of the network (if possible) using a best-fit
algorithm.
Otherwise it will allocate a job's resources onto multiple leaf switches
so as to minimize the use of higher-level switches.
The <B>TopologyPlugin</B> parameter controls which plugin is used to
collect network topology information.
The only values presently supported are
&quot;topology/3d_torus&quot; (default for IBM BlueGene, Sun Constellation and
Cray XT/XE systems, performs best-fit logic over three-dimensional topology),
&quot;topology/none&quot; (default for other systems,
best-fit logic over one-dimensional topology),
&quot;topology/tree&quot; (determine the network topology based
upon information contained in a topology.conf file,
see &quot;man topology.conf&quot; for more information).
Future plugins may gather topology information directly from the network.
The topology information is optional.
If not provided, SLURM will perform a best-fit algorithm assuming the
nodes are in a one-dimensional array as configured and the communications
cost is related to the node distance in this array.

<a id="SECTION_RELOCATING CONTROLLERS"></a>
<H2>RELOCATING CONTROLLERS</H2>

If the cluster's computers used for the primary or backup controller
will be out of service for an extended period of time, it may be
desirable to relocate them.
In order to do so, follow this procedure:
<P>

1. Stop the SLURM daemons
<BR>

2. Modify the slurm.conf file appropriately
<BR>

3. Distribute the updated slurm.conf file to all nodes
<BR>

4. Restart the SLURM daemons
<P>

There should be no loss of any running or pending jobs.
Insure that any nodes added to the cluster have the current
slurm.conf file installed.
<P>

<B>CAUTION:</B> If two nodes are simultaneously configured as the
primary controller (two nodes on which <B>ControlMachine</B> specify
the local host and the <B>slurmctld</B> daemon is executing on each),
system behavior will be destructive.
If a compute node has an incorrect <B>ControlMachine</B> or
<B>BackupController</B> parameter, that node may be rendered
unusable, but no other harm will result.

<H2>LOGGING</H2>

<P>

Note that while SLURM daemons create log files and other files as needed,
it treats the lack of parent directories as a fatal error.
This prevents the daemons from running if critical file systems are
not mounted and will minimize the risk of cold-starting (starting
without preserving jobs).
<P>

Log files and job accounting files,
may need to be created/owned by the &quot;SlurmUser&quot; uid to be successfully
accessed.  Use the &quot;chown&quot; and &quot;chmod&quot; commands to set the ownership
and permissions appropriately.
See the section <B>FILE AND DIRECTORY PERMISSIONS</B> for information
about the various files and directories used by SLURM.
<P>

It is recommended that the logrotate utility be used to insure that
various log files do not become too large. 
This also applies to text files used for accounting,
process tracking, and the slurmdbd log if they are used.
<P>

Here is a sample logrotate configuration. Make appropriate site modifications
and save as /etc/logrotate.d/slurm on all nodes.
See the <B>logrotate</B> man page for more details.
