<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>sacctmgr</B> is used to view or modify Slurm account information.
The account information is maintained within a database with the interface
being provided by <B>slurmdbd</B> (Slurm Database daemon).
This database can serve as a central storehouse of user and
computer information for multiple computers at a single site.
Slurm account information is recorded based upon four parameters
that form what is referred to as an <I>association</I>.
These parameters are <I>user</I>, <I>cluster</I>, <I>partition</I>, and
<I>account</I>. <I>user</I> is the login name.
<I>cluster</I> is the name of a Slurm managed cluster as specified by
the <I>ClusterName</I> parameter in the <I>slurm.conf</I> configuration file.
<I>partition</I> is the name of a Slurm partition on that cluster.
<I>account</I> is the bank account for a job.
The intended mode of operation is to initiate the <B>sacctmgr</B> command,
add, delete, modify, and/or list <I>association</I> records then
commit the changes and exit.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<a id="OPT_Note: "></a>
<DT><B>Note: </B><DD>The content's of SLURM's database are maintained in lower case. This may

To clear a previously set value use the modify command with a new value of -1.

NOTE: When read in from the slurmctld the default qos is checked against and if
the default qos isn't in the list of valid QOS for that association
and the association only has access to 1 QOS that will become the
default, otherwise, no default will be set.  This should only happen
when removing a QOS from a &lt;= 2.1 sacctmgr.
<P>
<DT><I>Fairshare</I>=&lt;fairshare number | parent&gt;<DD>

cluster.  So even though it may appear in sacctmgr output, it will not
be enforced.

ALSO NOTE: This limit only applies when using the Priority Multifactor
plugin.  The time is decayed using the value of PriorityDecayHalfLife

Specify the default Quality of Service's that jobs are able to run at
for this association.  To get a list of valid QOS's use 'sacctmgr list qos'.
This value will override its parents value and push down to its
children as the new default.  Setting a QosLevel to '' (two single
quotes with nothing between them) restores its default setting.  You
can also use the operator += and -= to add or remove certain QOS's
from a QOS list.

sacctmgr has the capability to load and dump SLURM association data to and
from a file.  This method can easily add a new cluster or copy an
existing clusters associations into a new cluster with similar
accounts. Each file contains SLURM association data for a single
cluster.  Comments can be put into the file with the # character.
Each line of information must begin with one of the four titles; <B>Cluster, Parent, Account or
User</B>. Following the title is a space, dash, space, entity value,
then specifications. Specifications are colon separated.  If any
variable such as Organization has a space in it, surround the name with
single or double quotes.
<P>
To create a file of associations one can run
<P>
&gt; sacctmgr dump tux file=tux.cfg
<BR>

(file=tux.cfg is optional)
<P>
To load a previously created file you can run
<P>
&gt; sacctmgr load file=tux.cfg
<P>
Other options for load are -
<P>
clean - delete what was already there and start from scratch with this
information.
<BR>

Cluster= - specify a different name for the cluster than that which is
in the file.
<P>
Quick explanation how the file works.
<P>
Since the associations in the system follow a hierarchy, so does the
file.  Anything that is a parent needs to be defined before any
children.  The only exception is the understood 'root' account.  This
is always a default for any cluster and does not need to be defined.
<P>
To edit/create a file start with a cluster line for the new cluster
<P>
<B>Cluster&nbsp;-&nbsp;cluster_name:MaxNodesPerJob=15</B>
<P>
Anything included on this line will be the defaults for all
associations on this cluster.  These options are as follows...

<H2>ARCHIVE FUNCTIONALITY</H2>

Sacctmgr has the capability to archive to a flatfile and or load that
data if needed later.  The archiving is usually done by the slurmdbd
and it is highly recommended you only do it through sacctmgr if you
completely understand what you are doing.  For slurmdbd options see
&quot;man slurmdbd&quot; for more information.
Loading data into the database can be done from these files to either
view old data or regenerate rolled up data.
<P>
These are the options for both dump and load of archive information.
<P>
archive dump
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><I>Directory=</I><DD>
Directory to store the archive data.
<DT><I>Events</I><DD>
Archive Events.  If not specified and PurgeEventAfter is set
all event data removed will be lost permanently.
<DT><I>Jobs</I><DD>
Archive Jobs.  If not specified and PurgeJobAfter is set
all job data removed will be lost permanently.
<DT><I>PurgeEventAfter=</I><DD>
Purge cluster event records older than time stated in months.  If you
want to purge on a shorter time period you can include hours, or days
behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges. (e.g. a
value of '12hours' would purge everything older than 12 hours.)
<DT><I>PurgeJobAfter=</I><DD>
Purge job records older than time stated in months.  If you
want to purge on a shorter time period you can include hours, or days
behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges. (e.g. a
value of '12hours' would purge everything older than 12 hours.)
<DT><I>PurgeStepAfter=</I><DD>
Purge step records older than time stated in months.  If you
want to purge on a shorter time period you can include hours, or days
behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges. (e.g. a
value of '12hours' would purge everything older than 12 hours.)
<DT><I>PurgeSuspendAfter=</I><DD>
Purge job suspend records older than time stated in months.  If you
want to purge on a shorter time period you can include hours, or days
behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges. (e.g. a
value of '12hours' would purge everything older than 12 hours.)
<DT><I>Script=</I><DD>
Run this script instead of the generic form of archive to flat files.
<DT><I>Steps</I><DD>
Archive Steps.  If not specified and PurgeStepAfter is set
all step data removed will be lost permanently.
<DT><I>Suspend</I><DD>
Archive Suspend Data.  If not specified and PurgeSuspendAfter is set
all suspend data removed will be lost permanently.
<P>

archive load
<DT><I>File=</I><DD>
File to load into database.
<DT><I>Insert=</I><DD>
SQL to insert directly into the database.  This should be used very
cautiously since this is writing your sql into the database.

When modifying an object placing the key words 'set' and the
optional 'where' is critical to perform correctly below are examples to
produce correct results.  As a rule of thumb anything you put in front
of the set will be used as a quantifier.  If you want to put a
quantifier after the key word 'set' you should use the key
word 'where'.
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

wrong&gt; sacctmgr modify user name=adam set fairshare=10 cluster=tux
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

This will produce an error as the above line reads modify user adam
set fairshare=10 and cluster=tux.
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

right&gt; sacctmgr modify user name=adam cluster=tux set fairshare=10
<BR>

right&gt; sacctmgr modify user name=adam set fairshare=10 where cluster=tux
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

When changing qos for something only use the '=' operator when wanting
to explicitly set the qos to something.  In most cases you will want
to use the '+=' or '\-=' operator to either add to or remove from the
existing qos already in place.
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

If a user already has qos of normal,standby for a parent or it was
explicitly set you should use qos+=expedite to add this to the list in
this fashion.
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

&gt; sacctmgr modify user name=adam set qos+=expedite
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

If you are looking to only add the qos expedite to only a certain
account and or cluster you can do that by specifying them in the
sacctmgr line.
<BR>

<P>
<BR>

&gt; sacctmgr modify user name=adam acct=this cluster=tux set qos+=expedite
