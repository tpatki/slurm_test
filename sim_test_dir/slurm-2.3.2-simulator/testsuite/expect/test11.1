# Purpose: Test of POE functionality
#          Test of nodes options (-nodes).
#          Test of procs options (-procs).
#
#
# Output:  "TEST: #.#" followed by "SUCCESS" if test was successful, OR
#          "FAILURE: ..." otherwise with an explanation of the failure, OR
#          anything else indicates a failure mode that must be investigated.
