Here is a list of the major SLURM components and who has
expertise in those areas. Anyone listed as a "Primary" 
has extensive knowledge of the component and is typically 
the author. Anyone listed as a "Backup" has a working 
knowledge of the component and should be able to address 
problems. Where I list the primary in parenthesis, that
indicates the person is actively developing the expertise
to serve as the primary contact for that component.
