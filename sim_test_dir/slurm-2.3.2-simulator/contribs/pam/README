Overview:
  Restricts access to compute nodes in a cluster using SLURM.

Recognized Arguments:
  debug; no_sys_info; no_warn; rsh_kludge; rlogin_kludge

Description:
  This module restricts access to compute nodes in a cluster where Simple 
  Linux Utility for Resource Managment (SLURM) is in use.  Access is granted
  to root, any user with an SLURM-launched job currently running on the node,
  or any user who has allocated resources on the node according to the SLURM
  database.

  The behavior of this module can be modified with the following flags:

    debug         - log debugging information to the system log file
    no_sys_info   - supress system logging of "access granted for user ...",
                    access denied and other errors will still be logged
    no_warn       - suppress warning messages to the application
    rsh_kludge    - prevent truncation of first char from rsh error msg
    rlogin_kludge - prevent "staircase-effect" following rlogin error msg

Examples / Suggested Usage:
  Use of this module is recommended on any compute node where you want to
  limit access to just those users who are currently scheduled to run jobs.

  For /etc/pam.d/ style configurations where modules live in /lib/security/,
  add the following line to the PAM configuration file for the appropriate
  service(s) (eg, /etc/pam.d/system-auth):

    account    required     /lib/security/pam_slurm.so

  If you always want to allow access for an administrative group (eg, wheel),
  stack the pam_access module ahead of pam_slurm:

    account    sufficient   /lib/security/pam_access.so
    account    required     /lib/security/pam_slurm.so

  Then edit the pam_access configuration file (/etc/security/access.conf):

    +:wheel:ALL
    -:ALL:ALL

  When access is denied because the user does not have an active job running
  on the node, an error message is returned to the application:

    Access denied: user foo (uid=1313) has no active jobs.

  This message can be suppressed by specifying the "no_warn" argument in the
  PAM configuration file.
