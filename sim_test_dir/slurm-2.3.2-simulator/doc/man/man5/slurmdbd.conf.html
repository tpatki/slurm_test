slurmdbd.conf - Slurm Database Daemon (SlurmDBD) configuration file
<P>
<A NAME="lbAC">&nbsp;</A>
<a id="SECTION_DESCRIPTION"></a>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B>slurmdb.conf</B> is an ASCII file which describes Slurm Database
Daemon (SlurmDBD) configuration information.
The file location can be modified at system build time using the
DEFAULT_SLURM_CONF parameter or at execution time by setting the SLURM_CONF
environment variable.
<P>

The contents of the file are case insensitive except for the names of nodes
and files. Any text following a &quot;#&quot; in the configuration file is treated
as a comment through the end of that line.
The size of each line in the file is limited to 1024 characters.
Changes to the configuration file take effect upon restart of
SlurmDbd or daemon receipt of the SIGHUP signal unless otherwise noted.
<P>

This file should be only on the computer where SlurmDBD executes and
should only be readable by the user which executes SlurmDBD (e.g. &quot;slurm&quot;).
This file should be protected from unauthorized access since it
contains a database password.
The overall configuration parameters available include:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<a id="OPT_ArchiveDir"></a>
<DT><B>ArchiveDir</B><DD>
If ArchiveScript is not set the slurmdbd will generate a file that can be
read in anytime with sacctmgr load filename.  This directory is where the
file will be placed archive has ran.  Default is /tmp.  The format for this
files name is

$ArchiveDir/$ClusterName_$ArchiveObject_archive_$BeginTimeStamp_$endTimeStamp

<P>
<a id="OPT_ArchiveEvents"></a>

This script can be executed every time a rollup happens (every hour,
day and month), depending on the Purge*After options.  This script is used
to transfer accounting records out of the database into an archive.  It is
used in place of the internal process used to acrhive objects.
The script is executed with a no arguments, The following environment
variables are set.

When purging steps also achive them.  Boolean, yes to archive step data,
no other wise.  Default is no.
<P>
<a id="OPT_ArchiveSuspend"></a>
<DT><B>ArchiveSuspend</B><DD>

<P>
<a id="OPT_AuthInfo"></a>
<DT><B>AuthInfo</B><DD>
Additional information to be used for authentication of communications
with the Slurm control daemon (slurmctld) on each cluster.
The interpretation of this option is specific to the configured <B>AuthType</B>.
In the case of <I>auth/munge</I>, this can be configured to use a Munge daemon
specifically configured to provide authentication between clusters while the
default Munge daemon provides authentication within a cluster.
In that case, this will specify the pathname of the socket to use. Per default
this value is left unspecified, which results in the default authentication
mechanism being used.
<P>
<a id="OPT_AuthType"></a>
<DT><B>AuthType</B><DD>
Define the authentication method for communications between SLURM
components.
Acceptable values at present include &quot;auth/none&quot;, &quot;auth/authd&quot;,
and &quot;auth/munge&quot;.
The default value is &quot;auth/none&quot;, which means the UID included in
communication messages is not verified.
This may be fine for testing purposes, but
<B>do not use &quot;auth/none&quot; if you desire any security</B>.
&quot;auth/authd&quot; indicates that Brett Chun's authd is to be used (see
&quot;<A HREF="http://www.theether.org/authd/">http://www.theether.org/authd/</A>&quot; for more information).
&quot;auth/munge&quot; indicates that LLNL's Munge system is to be used
(this is the best supported authentication mechanism for SLURM,
see &quot;<A HREF="http://home.gna.org/munge/">http://home.gna.org/munge/</A>&quot; for more information).
SlurmDbd must be terminated prior to changing the value of <B>AuthType</B>
and later restarted.
<P>
<a id="OPT_DbdBackupHost"></a>
<DT><B>DbdBackupHost</B><DD>
The name of the machine where the backup Slurm Database Daemon is executed.
This host must have access to the same underlying database specified by
the 'Storage' options mentioned below.
This should be a node name without the full domain name.  I.e., the hostname
returned by the <I>gethostname()</I> function cut at the first dot (e.g. use
&quot;tux001&quot; rather than &quot;tux001.my.com&quot;).
<P>
<a id="OPT_DbdHost"></a>
<DT><B>DbdHost</B><DD>
The name of the machine where the Slurm Database Daemon is executed.
This should be a node name without the full domain name.  I.e., the hostname
returned by the <I>gethostname()</I> function cut at the first dot (e.g. use
&quot;tux001&quot; rather than &quot;tux001.my.com&quot;).  This value must be specified.
<P>
<a id="OPT_DbdPort"></a>
<DT><B>DbdPort</B><DD>
The port number that the Slurm Database Daemon (slurmdbd) listens
to for work. The default value is SLURMDBD_PORT as established at system
build time. If none is explicitly specified, it will be set to 6819.
This value must be equal to the <B>AccountingStoragePort</B> parameter in the
slurm.conf file.
<P>
<a id="OPT_DebugLevel"></a>
<DT><B>DebugLevel</B><DD>
The level of detail to provide the Slurm Database Daemon's logs.
Values from 0 to 9 are legal, with `0' being &quot;quiet&quot; operation and
`9' being insanely verbose.
The default value is 3.
<P>
<a id="OPT_DefaultQOS"></a>
<DT><B>DefaultQOS</B><DD>
When adding a new cluster this will be used as the qos for the cluster
unless something is explicitly set by the admin with the create.
<P>
<a id="OPT_LogFile"></a>
<DT><B>LogFile</B><DD>
Fully qualified pathname of a file into which the Slurm Database Daemon's
logs are written.
The default value is none (performs logging via syslog).

<P>
<a id="OPT_PrivateData"></a>
<DT><B>PrivateData</B><DD>
This controls what type of information is hidden from regular users.
By default, all information is visible to all users.
User <B>SlurmUser</B>, <B>root</B>, and users with AdminLevel=Admin can always
view all information.
Multiple values may be specified with a comma separator.
Acceptable values include:
<DL COMPACT><DT><DD>

<P>
<a id="OPT_PurgeEventAfter"></a>
<DT><B>PurgeEventAfter</B><DD>
Events happening on the cluster over this age are purged from the database.
This includes node down times and such.
The time is a numeric value and is a number of months.  If you want to purge
more often you can include hours, or days behind the numeric value to get
those more frequent purges. (i.e. a value of '12hours' would purge
everything older than 12 hours.)
If not set (default), then job step records are never purged.
<P>
<a id="OPT_PurgeJobAfter"></a>
<DT><B>PurgeJobAfter</B><DD>
Individual job records over this age are purged from the database.
Aggregated information will be preserved indefinitely.
The time is a numeric value and is a number of months.  If you want to purge
more often you can include hours, or days behind the numeric value to get
those more frequent purges. (i.e. a value of '12hours' would purge

<P>
<a id="OPT_SlurmUser"></a>
<DT><B>SlurmUser</B><DD>
The name of the user that the <B>slurmctld</B> daemon executes as.
This user must exist on the machine executing the Slurm Database Daemon
and have the same user ID as the hosts on which <B>slurmctld</B> execute.

<P>
<a id="OPT_StorageBackupHost"></a>
<DT><B>StorageBackupHost</B><DD>
Define the name of the backup host the database is running where we are going
to store the data.  This can be viewed as a backup solution when the

coherency of the accounting information between the two hosts. With clustered
database solutions (active/passive HA), you would not need to use this feature.
Default is none.
<P>
<a id="OPT_StorageLoc"></a>
<DT><B>StorageLoc</B><DD>
Specify the name of the database as the location where accounting
records are written.
<P>

The value &quot;accounting_storage/gold&quot; indicates that account records
will be written to Gold

(<A HREF="http://www.clusterresources.com/pages/products/gold-allocation-manager.php),">http://www.clusterresources.com/pages/products/gold-allocation-manager.php),</A>

which maintains its own database.
The value &quot;accounting_storage/mysql&quot; indicates that accounting records
should be written to a MySQL database specified by the
torageLoc parameter.
The value &quot;accounting_storage/pgsql&quot; indicates that accounting records
should be written to a PostgreSQL database specified by the
<B>StorageLoc</B> parameter.  This plugin is not complete and
should not be used if wanting to use associations.  It will however work with
basic accounting of jobs and job steps.  If interested in
completing please email <A HREF="mailto:slurm-dev@lists.llnl.gov">slurm-dev@lists.llnl.gov</A>.
This value must be specified.
<P>
<a id="OPT_StorageUser"></a>
